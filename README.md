PowerBi dashboard is created based on sales data.

*Steps involved in creating a Power BI dashboard for sales insights using data from an SQL file :-*


1. Connect to SQL Server: The first step is to connect to the SQL server where the sales data is stored. 
You will need to provide the server name, database name, and login credentials to establish the connection.

2. Import Data: Once the connection is established, you can import the sales data into Power BI. 
This involves selecting the relevant tables and fields that you want to use in your dashboard.

3. Clean and Transform Data: It is likely that the data imported from SQL will need to be cleaned and transformed to make it more usable. 
This can involve tasks such as removing duplicates, filling in missing data, and aggregating data to a higher level (e.g. summarizing monthly sales).

4. Create Visualizations: With the cleaned and transformed data, you can start creating visualizations such as charts, tables, and maps.
These visualizations will help you to gain insights into the sales data and identify trends and patterns.

5. Create Calculated Fields: Power BI also allows you to create calculated fields that can be used in your visualizations. 
For example, you might want to calculate the profit margin for each product or customer.

6. Create Dashboard: Once you have created your visualizations and calculated fields, you can start building your dashboard. 
This involves organizing the visualizations on a single page and adding any necessary filters or slicers to enable interactive exploration of the data.

7. Publish and Share: Finally, you can publish your dashboard to the Power BI service so that others can view and interact with it.
You can also share your dashboard with specific individuals or groups within your organization, 
and set up automatic data refreshes so that the dashboard stays up to date with the latest sales data.

These are the general steps involved in creating a Power BI dashboard for sales insights using data from an SQL file.
